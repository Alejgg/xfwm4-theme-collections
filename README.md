## Xfwm Theme
These are only Window Border. The best GTK companion for these themes is [Lumiere](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/Openbox-Theme-Collections) or Lumiere-Magenta (included in this repo). I will create more theme later.

## Installation
Just clone this to your themes folder (but first make sure there is no *.git* folder inside your *~/.themes* folder, if You find it just delete)
```
git clone https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/Xfwm4-Theme-Collections ~/.themes
```
Then apply a theme You desire using Window Decorations in Your Xfce Settings Manager, and apply GTK theme using Appearance Settings

## Credits
These themes are inspired by [Faat Fuut](https://www.facebook.com/faat.fuut). And the Lumiere GTK Theme is based on Arc. I just replace some colors and icons.

## Note
Some of these themes **have no resize handle**, for aesthetic reason. Use *Alt + Right Click* to resize. And even worse, my *Lumiere-Magenta* theme is ridiculously flat. You can't see any buttons border, tabs border, textbox border, frame border, etc. Eye-candy first, usability second :p

If You need buttons border, tabs border, textbox border, frame border, etc. Use [this](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/Openbox-Theme-Collections) GTK Theme instead ;)

## License
Of course, GPL. Feel free to modify and share these themes.
